## Personal Background
Hi, My name is Will and I am a data analyst looking to grow my skills working with data to solve analytical problems. I am currently a computer science student and have completed courses in Data Science, Web Development, and Information Retrieval. These classes have given me an understanding of how to identify problems that can be addressed with analytical solutions, gather and manipulate data sources, and apply analysis to achieve insights. In my free time, I am interested in using data analytics to answer complex business and sports questions.
