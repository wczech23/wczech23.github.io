# Prospective Data Analyst

#### Technical Skills: SQL, Python, Excel, Tableau

## Personal Background
Hi, My name is Will and I am a data analyst looking to grow my skills working with data to solve analytical problems. I am currently a computer science student and have completed courses in Data Science, Web Development, and Information Retrieval. These classes have given me an understanding of how to identify problems that can be addressed with analytical solutions, gather and manipulate data sources, and apply analysis to achieve insights. In my free time, I am interested in using data analytics to answer complex business and sports questions. 

## Projects

### NBA Organization Efficiency
While looking at different NBA statistics, I wanted to know which organizations managed their resources well when it came to player spending and coaching. To do this, I gathered data on NBA teams for the past 19 seasons that tracked player efficiency, coaching efficiency, as well as player salaries. After cleaning the data using Python, I imported the files into Microsoft SQL Server where I created three statistics that represented the efficiency of each NBA team. These stats included the average efficiency of an organizations coaches, how many wins each player added based on their salary, and the overall amount of money each team spent to win. From these metrics, I created a data visualization dashboard in Tableau that can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/william.czech/viz/nba_team_analytics_proj/Dashboard2).
