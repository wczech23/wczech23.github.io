# My Project Portfolio

#### Technical Skills: SQL, Python, Excel, Tableau

## Personal Background
Hi, My name is Will and I am looking to grow my skills working with data to solve analytical problems. I am currently a computer science student and have completed courses in Data Science, Web Development, and Information Retrieval. These classes have given me an understanding of how to identify problems that can be addressed with analytical solutions, gather and manipulate data sources, and apply analysis to achieve insights. In my free time, I am interested in using data analytics to answer complex business and sports questions.

## Projects

### NBA Organization Efficiency - (Python, SQL, Tableau)
While looking at different NBA statistics, I wanted to know which organizations managed their resources well when it came to player spending and coaching. To do this, I gathered data on NBA teams for the past 19 seasons that tracked player efficiency, coaching efficiency, as well as player salaries. After cleaning the data using Python, I imported the files into Microsoft SQL Server where I created three statistics that represented the efficiency of each NBA team. These stats included the average efficiency of an organizations coaches, how many wins each player added based on their salary, and the overall amount of money each team spent to win. From these metrics, I created a data visualization dashboard in Tableau that can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/william.czech/viz/nba_team_analytics_proj/Dashboard2).

### Job Description Keyword Analyzer - (Python)
While applying for jobs, I was interested in how I could improve my performance with the applicant tracking systems (ATS) that analyzed my resume. To improve the scoring my resume earned from this system, I wanted to create an app that gathered 100s of job applications for any job title and analyzed the relevance of words within the job descriptions to understand which words were most valuable to include in my resume. I first web scraped 1000s of Wikipedia pages to gather enough text to build a word frequency model. After applying Python natural language processing libraries to create this model, I used the Adzuna job application API to gather job descriptions based on the search for a specific job title. Using the model and description data, I was able to find the most relevant keywords to add to my resume to make my applications more appealing to the applicant tracking system.
