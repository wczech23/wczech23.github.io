# Prospective Data Analyst

#### Technical Skills: SQL, Python, Excel, Tableau

## Personal Background
Hi, My name is Will and I am a data analyst looking to grow my skills working with data to solve analytical problems. I am currently a computer science student and have completed courses in Data Science, Web Development, and Information Retrieval. These classes have given me an understanding of how to identify problems that can be addressed with analytical solutions, gather and manipulate data sources, and apply analysis to achieve insights. In my free time, I am interested in using data analytics to answer complex business and sports questions. 

## Projects

### NBA Organization Efficiency
While looking at different NBA statistics, I wanted to know which organizations managed their resources well when it came to player spending and coaching. To do this, I gathered data on NBA teams for the past 19 seasons that tracked player efficiency, coaching efficiency, as well as player salaries. After cleaning the data using Python, I imported the files into Microsoft SQL Server where I created three statistics that represented the efficiency of each NBA team. These stats included the average efficiency of an organizations coaches, how many wins each player added based on their salary, and the overall amount of money each team spent to win. From these metrics, I created a data visualization dashboard in Tableau that can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/william.czech/viz/nba_team_analytics_proj/Dashboard2).

### Job Description Keyword Analyzer
Applying for jobs had become a difficult process for me because there were hundreds of applicants for each posting and I was having a hard time getting past the applicant tracking systems that analyzed my resume. To help improve my odds of getting past the tracker, I wanted to create a system that gathered many job applications given a keyword search and analyze the relevance of words within the job descriptions to find out which words I should include in my resume. To do this, I web scraped 1000s of Wikipedia pages to build a word frequency model that represented the rarity of English words. After creating this model, I used the Adzuna job application API to gather job descriptions based on the search for a specific role and compare the text with my model to find the most relevant words. After completing this project, I was able to search a role such as "Data Analyst" and find the most relevant keywords to add to my resume if I wanted to apply for a similar position.
